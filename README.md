# Dotfiles
Personal dotfiles of my Arch Linux setup for backup purposes and my own future reference.
This repo also includes the commands to install the specified packages, for Arch based distros.

For short, Dotfiles are text-based configuration files of Unix based systems. They can be used to customize your Linux installation.

## Why do this repository exists?

- I can use it as a backup, if needed;
- I can use it as a way of learning git;
- I can use it to easily share my dotfiles with other people;

## Softwares that I use in my Linux installation

- Display server: [X server](https://www.x.org/wiki/)
The most popular display manager in Linux. It works very well overall, but I'm planning to try out wayland too.
- Window manager: [Dinamyc Window Manager](https://dwm.suckless.org/)
A simple window manager written in C. The reason why I started using DWM was to pratice my C programming, since the only way to configure it is by editting the source code. But it ended up becoming my favorite Window manager.
- Terminal emulator: [Simple Terminal](https://st.suckless.org/)
It follows the same idea of DWM, it aims to be simple, fast and extensible by edditing the source code, that is written in C.
- Terminal shell: [Zshell](https://www.zsh.org/)
A very good middle ground between more raw shells like bash and friendly shells like fish. Also highly customizable due the great variety of plugins.
- Music player (backend): [Music Player Daemon](https://musicpd.org/)
A simple and flexible backend for playing music on Linux.
- Music player (frontend): [NCurses Music Player Client Plus Plus](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp)
A terminal frontend for playing music with MPD, it is lightweight and it has a various features.
- Video player: [mpv](https://mpv.io/)
A free and open source video player.
- Document viewer: [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)
A minimalistic and customizable document viewer. It can support different file formats through plugins.
- Text editor: [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
A fork of Vim, a powerfull and extensible text editor, made even better by the lua integration and improved codebase.
- Editor colorscheme:[Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)
A pleasant for the eyes and warm colorscheme, great for long sessions of programming.
