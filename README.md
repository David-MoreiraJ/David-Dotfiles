This repo contains personal dotfiles of my Arch Linux setup for backup purposes and my own future reference.

For short, Dotfiles are text-based configuration files of Unix based systems. They can be used to customize your Linux installation.

## Why do this repository exists?

- I can use it as a backup, if needed;
- I can use it as a way of learning git;
- I can use it to easily share my dotfiles with other people;

## Softwares that I use in my Linux installation
